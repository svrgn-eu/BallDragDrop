# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds comprehensive logging and error handling capabilities to the Ball Drag and Drop WPF application. The system will provide structured logging for debugging, monitoring, and troubleshooting purposes, while implementing robust error handling to ensure the application remains stable and provides meaningful feedback to users when issues occur.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive logging throughout the application, so that I can debug issues and monitor application behavior effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL log application startup information including version and configuration
2. WHEN any user interaction occurs (drag, drop, throw) THEN the system SHALL log the interaction details with appropriate log levels
3. WHEN any method is entered or exited THEN the system SHALL log method entry and exit with parameters at debug level
4. WHEN physics calculations are performed THEN the system SHALL log performance metrics and calculation results at debug level
5. WHEN the application encounters any error THEN the system SHALL log the error with full context including stack trace and relevant state information
6. WHEN the application shuts down THEN the system SHALL log shutdown information and flush all pending log entries

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want configurable logging levels and outputs, so that I can control the verbosity and destination of log information based on the environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is configured for different environments THEN the system SHALL support multiple log levels (Trace, Debug, Information, Warning, Error, Critical)
2. WHEN logging is configured THEN the system SHALL use Log4NET as the underlying logging framework
3. WHEN logging to file THEN the system SHALL write logs with minimum level INFO to log files with automatic rotation
4. WHEN logging to console or debug console THEN the system SHALL write logs with minimum level DEBUG
5. WHEN the logging service is used THEN the system SHALL provide an ILogService interface for dependency injection and testability

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle errors gracefully without crashing, so that I can continue using the application even when unexpected issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an unhandled exception occurs THEN the system SHALL catch it, log the error, and display a user-friendly error message
2. WHEN a physics calculation fails THEN the system SHALL reset the ball to a safe state and continue operation
3. WHEN file I/O operations fail THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and provide appropriate user feedback
4. WHEN memory allocation issues occur THEN the system SHALL attempt recovery and log the issue
5. WHEN the application encounters a critical error THEN the system SHALL save the current state before attempting recovery

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a support technician, I want detailed error reports with context information, so that I can quickly identify and resolve user issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL capture relevant application state including ball position, velocity, and user actions
2. WHEN an exception is logged THEN the system SHALL include environment information such as OS version, .NET version, and available memory
3. WHEN errors are reported THEN the system SHALL provide correlation IDs to track related log entries
4. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL generate detailed error reports that can be easily shared for support
5. WHEN performance issues are detected THEN the system SHALL log performance metrics and system resource usage

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want structured logging with consistent formatting, so that logs can be easily parsed and analyzed by monitoring tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN log entries are created THEN the system SHALL use a consistent structured format with timestamp, level, category, and message
2. WHEN logging contextual information THEN the system SHALL include relevant properties as structured data rather than string interpolation
3. WHEN logging user actions THEN the system SHALL include action type, duration, and outcome as structured properties
4. WHEN logging performance data THEN the system SHALL include metrics as structured numeric values for analysis
5. WHEN integrating with external logging systems THEN the system SHALL support JSON formatting for log entries

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean logging interface that can be easily injected into classes, so that I can implement logging consistently across the application without tight coupling to specific logging frameworks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN classes need logging functionality THEN the system SHALL provide an ILogService interface that can be injected via dependency injection
2. WHEN the ILogService is implemented THEN the system SHALL use Log4NET as the concrete implementation
3. WHEN logging methods are called THEN the system SHALL support all standard log levels through the interface
4. WHEN method entry/exit logging is needed THEN the system SHALL provide convenient methods for automatic parameter logging
5. WHEN the logging implementation needs to be changed THEN the system SHALL allow swapping implementations without changing consuming code
