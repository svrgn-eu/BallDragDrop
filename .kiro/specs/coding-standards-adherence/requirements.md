# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will implement automated coding standards adherence for the BallDragDrop project. The system will enforce consistent code formatting, naming conventions, and best practices across the C# codebase to improve code quality, maintainability, and team collaboration.

## Current Project Structure

The BallDragDrop solution consists of:
- **BallDragDrop** (Main Project): WPF application with Models, Services, ViewModels, and Views folders
- **BallDragDrop.Tests** (Test Project): Unit tests for the main project
- **Services Folder**: Contains service implementations including ServiceBootstrapper.cs
- **Models Folder**: Contains domain models like BallModel.cs and PhysicsEngine.cs
- **ViewModels Folder**: Contains view model classes
- **Views Folder**: Contains XAML views and code-behind files

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated code formatting to be enforced, so that all code follows consistent styling rules without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer saves a C# file THEN the system SHALL automatically format the code according to predefined standards
2. WHEN code formatting rules are violated THEN the system SHALL highlight violations in the IDE
3. WHEN the project is built THEN the system SHALL fail the build if critical formatting violations exist
4. WHEN formatting is applied THEN the system SHALL preserve code functionality and logic

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want naming convention enforcement, so that all code elements follow consistent naming patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a class is created THEN the system SHALL enforce PascalCase naming convention
2. WHEN a method is created THEN the system SHALL enforce PascalCase naming convention
3. WHEN a private field is created THEN the system SHALL enforce camelCase with underscore prefix naming convention
4. WHEN a property is created THEN the system SHALL enforce PascalCase naming convention
5. WHEN naming violations are detected THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with suggested corrections

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want project structure standards enforced, so that code organization follows established patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN interfaces or abstract classes are created THEN the system SHALL enforce placement in a "Contracts" subfolder
2. WHEN bootstrapper files are created THEN the system SHALL enforce placement in a "Bootstrapper" subfolder within the project
3. WHEN project structure violations are detected THEN the system SHALL provide warnings with correct folder suggestions
4. WHEN new folders are created THEN the system SHALL validate against approved project structure patterns

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want method organization standards enforced, so that code structure is consistent and readable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a method is created THEN the system SHALL enforce enclosure within regions following "#region MethodName" and "#endregion MethodName" format
2. WHEN region naming is incorrect THEN the system SHALL provide warnings with correct naming suggestions
3. WHEN methods are not properly enclosed in regions THEN the system SHALL flag violations
4. WHEN multiple methods exist THEN the system SHALL validate that each has its own properly named region

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive XML documentation standards enforced, so that all methods have proper documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a method is created THEN the system SHALL enforce comprehensive XML header documentation
2. WHEN XML documentation is missing exception information THEN the system SHALL require documentation of all exceptions that might be thrown
3. WHEN XML documentation is incomplete THEN the system SHALL flag missing summary, parameters, return values, and exceptions
4. WHEN documentation format is incorrect THEN the system SHALL provide formatting suggestions
5. WHEN public methods lack documentation THEN the system SHALL prevent compilation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want code quality rules to be enforced, so that common coding mistakes and anti-patterns are prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unused variables are detected THEN the system SHALL flag them as warnings
2. WHEN methods exceed complexity thresholds THEN the system SHALL flag them for refactoring
3. WHEN null reference potential is detected THEN the system SHALL provide warnings
4. WHEN code smells are identified THEN the system SHALL suggest improvements
5. WHEN critical violations are found THEN the system SHALL prevent code compilation

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want configurable rule sets, so that coding standards can be customized for different project requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration files are modified THEN the system SHALL apply new rules without requiring project restart
2. WHEN rules conflict THEN the system SHALL prioritize based on defined hierarchy
3. WHEN custom rules are needed THEN the system SHALL support adding project-specific standards
4. WHEN rules are disabled THEN the system SHALL respect the configuration and skip those checks

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration with the build process, so that coding standards are enforced during continuous integration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is committed THEN the system SHALL run standards validation as part of CI/CD pipeline
2. WHEN standards violations are found during build THEN the system SHALL fail the build with detailed reports
3. WHEN the build passes THEN the system SHALL generate a code quality report
4. WHEN violations are fixed THEN the system SHALL allow the build to proceed successfully

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want code organization with regions, so that all class files have consistent structure and improved readability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a class file is created THEN the system SHALL enforce organization into "Properties", "Construction", and "Methods" regions
2. WHEN regions are created THEN the system SHALL enforce named beginning and end tags (e.g., "#region Properties" and "#endregion Properties")
3. WHEN properties are added to a class THEN the system SHALL require placement within the "Properties" region
4. WHEN constructors are added to a class THEN the system SHALL require placement within the "Construction" region
5. WHEN methods are added to a class THEN the system SHALL require placement within the "Methods" region
6. WHEN region violations are detected THEN the system SHALL provide warnings with correct region placement suggestions
