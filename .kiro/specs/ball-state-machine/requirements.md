# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature introduces a state machine implementation using the Stateless library for .NET to manage the various states of the ball in the BallDragDrop application. The state machine will track and control transitions between different ball states such as "Idle", "Thrown", and "Held", providing a structured approach to managing ball behavior and ensuring consistent state transitions throughout the application lifecycle.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a state machine to manage ball states, so that the ball behavior is predictable and state transitions are properly controlled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the ball SHALL be in the "Idle" state
2. WHEN the ball is clicked and dragged THEN the system SHALL transition the ball to the "Held" state
3. WHEN the ball is released after being held THEN the system SHALL transition the ball to the "Thrown" state
4. WHEN the ball comes to rest after being thrown THEN the system SHALL transition the ball back to the "Idle" state
5. IF the ball is in "Held" state THEN the system SHALL prevent physics calculations from affecting the ball position
6. IF the ball is in "Thrown" state THEN the system SHALL allow physics calculations to control the ball movement

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want state transition validation, so that invalid state changes are prevented and the application remains stable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an invalid state transition is attempted THEN the system SHALL reject the transition and maintain the current state
2. WHEN a state transition occurs THEN the system SHALL log the transition for debugging purposes
3. IF the ball is in "Thrown" state THEN the system SHALL NOT allow direct transition to "Held" state without first going to "Idle"
4. IF the ball is in "Idle" state THEN the system SHALL allow transition to either "Held" or "Thrown" states

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want state change notifications, so that other components can react to ball state changes appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a state transition occurs THEN the system SHALL notify all registered observers of the state change
2. WHEN the ball enters "Held" state THEN the system SHALL notify the physics engine to pause calculations for the ball
3. WHEN the ball enters "Thrown" state THEN the system SHALL notify the physics engine to resume calculations for the ball
4. WHEN the ball enters "Idle" state THEN the system SHALL notify the UI to update visual indicators appropriately

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want visual feedback of ball states, so that I can understand the current state of the ball interaction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the ball is in "Idle" state THEN the system SHALL display the ball with default visual appearance
2. WHEN the ball is in "Held" state THEN the system SHALL display visual feedback indicating the ball is being held
3. WHEN the ball is in "Thrown" state THEN the system SHALL display visual feedback indicating the ball is in motion
4. IF the ball state changes THEN the system SHALL update the visual representation within 100 milliseconds
5. WHEN the ball state changes THEN the system SHALL display the current state in the status bar's "Status" field
6. IF the ball is in "Idle" state THEN the status bar SHALL display "Ball: Idle"
7. IF the ball is in "Held" state THEN the status bar SHALL display "Ball: Held"
8. IF the ball is in "Thrown" state THEN the status bar SHALL display "Ball: Thrown"

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the state machine to integrate with existing ball physics, so that state-dependent behavior is properly coordinated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the ball is in "Held" state THEN the physics engine SHALL NOT update the ball's position based on gravity or velocity
2. WHEN the ball transitions from "Held" to "Thrown" THEN the system SHALL apply the release velocity to the physics calculations
3. WHEN the ball is in "Thrown" state AND velocity drops below threshold THEN the system SHALL automatically transition to "Idle" state
4. IF the ball collides with boundaries while in "Thrown" state THEN the system SHALL maintain the "Thrown" state until velocity threshold is met

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want a reset function to return the ball to its initial state, so that I can restart the interaction from a clean state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the reset function is triggered THEN the ball state SHALL transition to "Idle" regardless of current state
2. WHEN the reset function is triggered THEN the ball position SHALL be reset to the center of the canvas
3. WHEN the reset function is triggered THEN the ball velocity SHALL be set to zero
4. WHEN the reset function is triggered THEN any ongoing physics simulation SHALL be stopped
5. IF the ball is currently being dragged THEN the reset function SHALL release the drag operation before resetting
6. WHEN the reset function completes THEN the status bar SHALL display "Ball: Idle"
7. WHEN the reset function is triggered THEN the state machine SHALL fire the Reset trigger to ensure proper state transition
8. IF the ball is in any state other than Idle THEN the reset function SHALL force the transition to Idle state
