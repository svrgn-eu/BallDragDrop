# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables the Ball Drag and Drop application to use custom PNG images as mouse cursors that change based on hand/interaction state. The cursor system will be configurable, allowing users to specify different PNG files for different hand states (Default, Hover, Grabbing, Releasing), with all cursors standardized to 30x30 pixels for consistency and performance. The hand state machine operates independently from the ball state machine but responds to both ball state changes and mouse interaction events.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see custom PNG cursors that change based on my hand/interaction state, so that I have visual feedback about what actions are available and what I'm currently doing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load the default PNG cursor from configuration
2. WHEN the hand state changes THEN the system SHALL update the cursor to match the new hand state
3. WHEN a PNG cursor is loaded THEN the system SHALL resize it to exactly 30x30 pixels
4. IF a configured PNG file is missing THEN the system SHALL fall back to the default system cursor and log a warning

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure which PNG files are used for different hand states, so that I can customize the visual experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL read cursor configuration from appsettings.json
2. WHEN cursor configuration is updated THEN the system SHALL reload the cursor mappings without requiring application restart
3. IF no cursor configuration exists THEN the system SHALL use default system cursors
4. WHEN a hand state is not configured THEN the system SHALL use the default cursor for that state

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the cursor system to have its own hand state machine that responds to both ball state changes and mouse interactions, so that cursor changes happen automatically and appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the mouse is not over any interactive element THEN the system SHALL show the Default hand state cursor
2. WHEN hovering over the ball while it's idle THEN the system SHALL show the Hover hand state cursor
3. WHEN dragging a ball THEN the system SHALL show the Grabbing hand state cursor
4. WHEN releasing a ball THEN the system SHALL briefly show the Releasing hand state cursor before returning to Default
5. WHEN the ball state changes THEN the hand state machine SHALL evaluate and potentially update the hand state

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the cursor changes to be smooth and performant, so that the application remains responsive during interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hand state changes occur THEN the system SHALL complete the cursor change within 16ms to maintain 60fps
2. WHEN multiple rapid hand state changes occur THEN the system SHALL debounce cursor updates to prevent flickering
3. WHEN PNG files are loaded THEN the system SHALL cache them in memory for performance
4. IF cursor loading fails THEN the system SHALL not block the UI thread

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the cursor system to handle errors gracefully, so that cursor issues don't crash the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. IF a PNG file cannot be loaded THEN the system SHALL log the error and use the default cursor
2. IF a PNG file is corrupted THEN the system SHALL handle the exception and fall back gracefully
3. WHEN cursor configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL use default cursors and log validation errors
4. IF memory allocation for cursor fails THEN the system SHALL continue with system cursors
5. IF the hand state machine encounters an error THEN the system SHALL reset to Default hand state
