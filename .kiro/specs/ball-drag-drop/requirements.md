# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a desktop application that allows users to drag and drop a bitmap of a ball around the application window. The application will provide a simple, intuitive interface for users to interact with the ball graphic through mouse or touch input.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Application Window

**User Story:** As a user, I want a desktop application with a clean interface, so that I can focus on interacting with the ball graphic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL display a window with appropriate dimensions.
2. WHEN the application window is displayed THEN the system SHALL have a clear title indicating the purpose of the application.
3. WHEN the user resizes the window THEN the system SHALL maintain the ball's relative position within the new dimensions.
4. WHEN the user attempts to close the window THEN the system SHALL properly terminate the application.

### Requirement 2: Ball Graphic Display

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a visual representation of a ball displayed in the application window, so that I have a visual element to interact with.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL display a visual representation of a ball at a default position.
2. WHEN the ball visual is displayed THEN the system SHALL render it with appropriate size and quality.
3. WHEN the ball visual is a static image THEN the system SHALL support common bitmap formats (PNG, JPG, BMP).
4. WHEN the ball visual is an animation THEN the system SHALL support animated formats (GIF, APNG) or frame-based animations.
5. WHEN an animated ball is displayed THEN the system SHALL play the animation continuously while the ball is visible.
6. WHEN the ball is being dragged THEN the system SHALL maintain animation playback if the ball is animated.
7. IF the ball image or animation cannot be loaded THEN the system SHALL display a fallback graphic or error message.
8. WHEN the application window is resized THEN the system SHALL maintain the ball's visual quality regardless of whether it's static or animated.

### Requirement 3: Drag and Drop Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want to drag and drop the ball around the application window using my mouse or touch input, so that I can position it wherever I want.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks/touches the ball image THEN the system SHALL select the ball for movement.
2. WHEN the user moves the cursor/finger while holding the ball THEN the system SHALL move the ball to follow the cursor/finger position.
3. WHEN the user releases the click/touch THEN the system SHALL place the ball at the final position.
4. WHEN the ball is being dragged THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback to indicate the ball is being moved.
5. WHEN the cursor hovers over the ball THEN the system SHALL change the cursor to indicate the ball can be grabbed.
6. WHEN the user is dragging the ball THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate cursor to indicate the ball is being moved.
7. IF the user attempts to drag the ball outside the application window THEN the system SHALL keep the ball within the window boundaries.

### Requirement 4: Ball Throwing Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want to throw the ball with momentum by moving it swiftly and releasing, so that I can enjoy more dynamic interactions with the ball.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user moves the ball swiftly and releases the mouse button THEN the system SHALL apply momentum to the ball's movement.
2. WHEN the ball is thrown THEN the system SHALL calculate the velocity based on the speed and direction of the mouse movement before release.
3. WHEN the ball is in motion after being thrown THEN the system SHALL gradually slow down the ball due to simulated friction.
4. WHEN the thrown ball reaches the edge of the window THEN the system SHALL make the ball bounce off the edge with appropriate physics.
5. WHEN the ball is in motion THEN the system SHALL allow the user to grab it again to stop or redirect its movement.

### Requirement 5: Performance and Responsiveness

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to be responsive and smooth when interacting with the ball, so that I have a satisfying user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user drags the ball THEN the system SHALL update the ball's position with minimal latency.
2. WHEN the application is running THEN the system SHALL maintain a consistent frame rate.
3. WHEN the ball is moved THEN the system SHALL render the movement smoothly without visual artifacts.
4. IF the system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL prioritize input responsiveness over visual effects.

### Requirement 6: Image and Animation Support

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to support both static images and animations for the ball, including formats exported from Aseprite, so that I can use my pixel art creations in the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads ball visuals THEN the system SHALL automatically detect whether the file is a static image or animation.
2. WHEN a static image is used THEN the system SHALL support PNG, JPG, and BMP formats.
3. WHEN an animation is used THEN the system SHALL support GIF format for simple animations.
4. WHEN Aseprite animations are used THEN the system SHALL support PNG sprite sheets with accompanying JSON metadata files.
5. WHEN loading Aseprite exports THEN the system SHALL parse the JSON metadata to determine frame timing, dimensions, and animation sequences.
6. WHEN multiple animation sequences exist in an Aseprite export THEN the system SHALL use the default or first animation sequence.
7. WHEN switching between static and animated ball representations THEN the system SHALL maintain all drag and drop functionality.
8. WHEN an animated ball is used THEN the system SHALL ensure animation performance does not impact drag responsiveness.
9. WHEN the ball visual is changed THEN the system SHALL update the display without requiring application restart.
10. IF JSON metadata is missing for a PNG sprite sheet THEN the system SHALL attempt to treat it as a static image or provide appropriate error feedback.

### Requirement 7: Technology Stack

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to be built using .NET 9 with WPF, so that it leverages modern development frameworks and capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is developed THEN the system SHALL use .NET 9 as the framework.
2. WHEN the application UI is implemented THEN the system SHALL use Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF).
3. WHEN the application is deployed THEN the system SHALL run on Windows operating systems that support .NET 9.
4. WHEN the application is built THEN the system SHALL follow WPF best practices for structure and performance.
