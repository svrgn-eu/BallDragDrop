## Requirements

- Windows operating system
- .NET 9.0 or later

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ball-drag-drop.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd ball-drag-drop
   ```

3. Build the application:
   ```cmd
   dotnet build
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```cmd
   dotnet run --project src/BallDragDrop
   ```

### Quick Start Guide üöÄ

1. **Launch the app** - Run the command above and wait for the window to appear
2. **Find the ball** - You'll see a ball in the center of the window
3. **Hover over it** - Notice how the cursor changes to indicate it's interactive
4. **Click and drag** - Grab the ball and move it around (cursor changes again!)
5. **Release to throw** - Let go while moving to throw the ball with physics
6. **Watch it bounce** - The ball will bounce realistically off the window edges
7. **Try resizing** - Resize the window and see how the ball maintains its relative position

**Pro Tip**: Pay attention to the cursor changes - they provide instant feedback about what you can do!

### Usage

- **Drag the ball**: Click and hold the left mouse button on the ball, then move the mouse.
- **Throw the ball**: Drag the ball and release the mouse button while moving to throw it.
- **Grab the ball in motion**: Click on the ball while it's moving to stop and grab it.
- **Resize the window**: The ball will maintain its relative position within the window.

### Interactive Cursor Guide üñ±Ô∏è

The application features dynamic cursors that change based on your interaction:

| Action | Cursor Change | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| **Move mouse around** | Default cursor | Normal navigation mode |
| **Hover over ball** | Changes to hover cursor | Ball is ready to be grabbed |
| **Click and hold ball** | Changes to grabbing cursor | Ball is being dragged |
| **Release ball** | Briefly shows releasing cursor | Ball has been released and is in motion |

**Tip**: Watch the cursor changes to get immediate visual feedback about your interaction state with the ball!

## Architecture

The application follows MVVM pattern with clean separation of concerns, dependency injection, comprehensive logging, and extensive code quality enforcement through custom analyzers and coding standards.

### Core Components

- **Models**: Business logic and data representation
  - `BallModel`: Ball's physical properties and state
  - `PhysicsEngine`: Physics calculations for movement and collisions

- **ViewModels**: MVVM intermediary layer
  - `BallViewModel`: Exposes ball properties and commands for UI binding

- **Views**: WPF user interface
  - `MainWindow`: Primary application window with ball interaction
  - `SplashScreen`: Application startup screen

- **Services**: Application services and utilities
  - Logging services with log4net integration
  - Configuration management
  - Performance monitoring

- **State Management**: Stateless state machine for ball behavior transitions

## Performance Optimizations

- Hardware acceleration for smooth rendering
- Frame rate limiting to reduce CPU usage
- Event throttling for mouse move events
- Bitmap caching for improved rendering performance
- Optimized image loading with proper sizing

## Development Commands

### Build and Run
```cmd
# Build the solution
dotnet build

# Run the application
dotnet run --project src/BallDragDrop

## Custom Cursor System ‚ú®

The application now features a sophisticated custom cursor system that provides visual feedback during ball interactions. The cursor changes dynamically based on your interaction state with the ball.

### Cursor States

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Default** | Standard cursor when not interacting with the ball |
| **Hover** | Cursor when hovering over the ball |
| **Grabbing** | Cursor when clicking and dragging the ball |
| **Releasing** | Brief cursor shown when releasing the ball |

### How to Use Custom Cursors

1. **Hover Over Ball**: Move your mouse over the ball to see the hover cursor
2. **Grab the Ball**: Click and hold on the ball to see the grabbing cursor
3. **Drag and Release**: Move the ball around and release to see the releasing cursor
4. **Normal Navigation**: Move away from the ball to return to the default cursor

### Configuration

Custom cursors can be configured in `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "CustomCursorsEnabled": true,
  "CursorPaths": {
    "Default": "Resources/Cursors/default.png",
    "Hover": "Resources/Cursors/hover.png",
    "Grabbing": "Resources/Cursors/grabbing.png",
    "Releasing": "Resources/Cursors/releasing.png"
  }
}
```

### Troubleshooting

If custom cursors are not appearing:
1. Ensure PNG files exist in `Resources/Cursors/`
2. Check that `CustomCursorsEnabled` is set to `true` in configuration
3. Verify the application has read access to the cursor files
4. Check the application logs for cursor loading errors
